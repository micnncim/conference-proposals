## Talk Details

### Title

Microservices empowered by Go, gRPC and Monorepo

### Elevator Pitch

> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

Development of the microservice architecture is a hard way. Adopting Go and gRPC, we can develop scalable microservices. And our focus is how we work. Whether should we employ monorepo or polyrepo? How should we manage libraries, build and deployment? In the session, I introduce my solution.

Recently, many developers are working with microservices. And Go is one of most popular languages in term of microservice architecture. From a point of view about infrastructure (e.g. How should we deploy microservices?, How should we monitor system?), many discussions have gone, but we have less discussion on development of microservices. So I'd like to talk about this, specially Go today, from the experience with development of some products with microservice architecture.

This session aims to those who interested in development of microservice with Go.

I'll show the agenda of my talk.

1. Self Introduction (1min)
2. Mircoservices in Go (10min)
3. Go with gRPC (10min)
4. Monorepo with microservices (10min)
5. Conclusion (4min)
6. Q&A (15min)

### 1. Self Introduction (1min)

Just my self introduction.

### 2. Mircoservices in Go (10min)

In this section, I'll introduce why we work with the microservice architecture, and why we adopt Go for microservices.

### 3. Go with gRPC (10min)

In this section, I'll explain the difference of REST and gRPC. Which/How should we develop? And I'll introduce the best practices, tips and tricks from my experiences.

### 4. Monorepo with microservices (10min)

In this section, I'll focus on development with monorepo, and talk about how we should work it with Go.

- Monorepo vs Polyrepo: Pros and Cons
- Monorepo loves Go and gRPC. Why?
- Best practices of development with monorepo

### 5. Conclusion (4min)

I'll conclude

### 6. Q&A (15min)

I welcome Q&A and discussion with attendees. I'd like to give my ideas and also learn a lot from their questions and ideas.

### Notes

> This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

I've been developing some products of microservice architecture with Go and gRPC on Kubernetes. While the discussions on infrastructure are interesting, I also love talking how developers work. So I'd like to discuss this.

### Tags

> Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".
